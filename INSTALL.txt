Fast Holographic Deconvolution IDL installation instructions


1 Download the latest versions of the following libraries:	

a. this repository (https://github.com/EoRImaging/FHD/)

b. the power spectrum generation code (https://github.com/EoRImaging/eppsilon/)

c. the astro IDL library (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

d. the coyote library (http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php)

e. the HEALPix library (http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/healpixSoftwareCapabilities.shtml)

*****
I got HEALPix from http://sourceforge.net/projects/healpix/ as the NASA page seemed out-of-date
*****

2 Add these libraries to your IDL path in the order listed

a. To add a library to your path, on Windows machines type (on the IDL command line)
!PATH = !PATH + ';' + Expand_Path('+path\to\library\')

And on Unix-based machines type
*****
!PATH = Expand_Path('+path/to/library/') + ':' + !PATH
(I remember that you told me to switch the order for the IDL PATH.)
*****

Be sure to use the correct separator (; or : ) and include the ‘+’ sign at the start of +path/to/library/

*****
You can create an IDL startup file to set the IDL path.

(Not sure if we want to reproduce the instructions or just point people to that page.)

3 Install HEALPix, as http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/html/install.htm

4 Install Imagemagick if not already present (http://www.imagemagick.org)

*****
On eor-01, I had to install the i386 version of Imagemagick even though x86_64 was already installed. Maybe it's important to specify the version. 
*****

5 Open a fresh terminal and start IDL to test the installation. Suggested test commands:

print,cgHasImageMagick() 
[prints error if coyote library not installed, returns 0 if coyote library installed but Imagemagick not installed correctly, and returns 1 if both are installed correctly]
astrolib  [prints error if astro IDL library not installed correctly, prints message “ASTROLIB: Astronomy Library system variables have been added” if installed correctly]

init_healpix 
[prints error if HEALPix not installed correctly]

imagefast,randomN(5,256,256),file_path='some/output/path/testimage.png' 
[prints error if FHD not installed correctly, generates a 256x256 pixel image of poisson noise at path 'some/output/path/testimage.png' if installed correctly and read/write permissions are set correctly]

If the above commands all work, it’s time to try it out on some data:
